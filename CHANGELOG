Version History:

2.0.6   Performed the following upgrades/fixes:
          1.) Corrected typographical errors in several files, both in the admin pages, and in the config files.
          2.0 Consolidated error logging, adding a /logs/ folder to the base directory. Error logs are
            also named for the pages where the errors occur. (e.g. admin-error.log for the admin pages,
            install-error.log, etc.)
          3.) Updated the addon checkForBan, activating it, and adding functionality to add banned users
            to the list of banned IP addresses. It's still up to the botmaster to implement banning in
            their AIML files. To ban a user, insert the following into the apropriate AIML template:
            <ban><get name="ip_address" /></ban>
        For further assistance, please check out the Program O Support Forums.

2.0.5   Fixed a bug where uploaded AIML files were not being added to the DB, even if they passed validation.
        Also added the variable $default_charset to allow character encoding other than UTF-8 for both AIML
        files and chatbot pages. Further, experimental support for international characters has been added.
        This is far from it's "final" implementation, but we hope that it's a start.

2.0.4   Fixed a bug in the debugging functions that caused empty debugging files to be created on non-Windows systems

2.0.3   Added simple AIML validation to the upload script, and restyled the admin pages accordingly

2.0.2   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.1   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.0   Initial Release
