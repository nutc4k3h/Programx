Version History:

2.0.5   Fixed a bug where uploaded AIML files were not being added to the DB, even if the passed validation.
        Also added the variable $default_charset to allow character encoding other than UTF-8 for both AIML
        files and chatbot pages. Further, experimental support for international characters has been added.
        This is far from it's "final" implementation, but we hope that it's a start.

2.0.4   Fixed a bug in the debugging functions that caused empty debugging files to be created on non-Windows systems

2.0.3   Added simple AIML validation to the upload script, and restyled the admin pages accordingly

2.0.2   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.1   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.0   Initial Release
