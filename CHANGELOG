Version History:

2.1.5   Bug fixes/merge to "Master" branch
            1.) Corrected a bug that improperly ordered the collections of words gathered in <pattern> and <that> tags
            2.) Corrected multiple minor bugs in the Download script that affected the use of said downloaded AIML
                files with Pandorabots.
            3.) Adjusted the function that checks GitHub for the current version of the script, based on changes they
                made to their API. Also added some error handling, in case GitHub can't be reached.
            4.) Modified some of the debugging output descriptors to avoid unnecessary and potentially confusing
                message duplication.
            5.) Corrected a bug in the main SQL query that caused certain valid AIML categories that use the <that> tag
                to be missed in the main search.
            6.) Added 'experimental' support for Pandorabots style <date> tags, adding functionality for both LOCALE
                and TIMEZONE attributes (support for these attributes was mentioned previously, but not added at that
                time).
            7.) Other minor cosmetic changes and typo corrections that didn't affect functionality.

2.1.4   Bug fixes & minor styling/feature changes
            1.) Fixed several bugs that arose from the database refactor.
            2.) Fixed the long-standing bug that caused the script to create a new user
                instead of just updating the current user when they typed in the phrase
                "clear properties".
            3.) Fixed bugs in both the word censor and spell checker addons that prevented
                botmasters from making changes to the DB.
            4.) Updated the spell checker addon to allow botmasters to enable/disable
                spell checking by editing the config file. In time, this will expand to
                the ability to enable or disable the addon per bot (future plans).
            5.) Changed the styling of the admin pages to include visible cues for BBCode
                [code] blocks from the Program O Support Forums, when viewing posts from
                the Support tab of the admin pages.

2.1.3   Added the last of the AIML tag functions/Refactored the DB/Multiple Bug Fixes
            1.) Added functions for the remaining AIML tags:
                <thatstar>
                <topicstar>
                <gossip>
            2.) Refactored the database, standardizing field names across all of the tables.
            3.) Refactored the admin pages, replacing $_GET, $_POST and $_REQUEST with input
                filtering functions.
            4.) Fixed several minor bugs that were discovered during the database refactoring
                process.
            5.) Re-designed the AIML tag functions, consolidating duplicate code into a single
                function. this cut more than 70 lines of code from the script while retaining
                exactly the same functionality and performance.
            6.) Created an experimental config file editor to the admin folder, to allow
                botmasters to edit the file directly. For now, the script doesn't actually
                change the config file, but that functionality will be added in the coming
                weeks.
            7.) Updated and modified the automatic upgrade script to incorporate all of the
                above listed changes.

2.1.2   Added more AIML tag functions/Script Streamlining
            1.) Added functions for the following AIML tags:
               <condition>
               <system>
               <learn>
            2.) I went through the entire script, looking for and deleting "orphaned" functions
                and streamlining code wherever possible.

2.1.1   Added functions for some AIML tags
            1.) Added functions for the following AIML tags:
                <gender>
                <person>
                <person2>

2.1.0   Major revision change / Bug fixes
            1.) Altered the way that client properties are handled, by storing them in a table
                in the DB, rather than keeping them in an element of the conversation array.
            2.) Removed the AIML to PHP code functions, replacing it with an XML parser to
                both improve performance and to address several bugs that arose from trying to
                evaluate faulty PHP code strings.
            3.) removed the function get_convo_var, replacing calls to that function with direct
                queries to the conversation array.
            4.) Corrected several minor bugs that were preventing proper use/setting of some variables
        Please note that at this point, several functions still need to be written to parse certain AIML
        tags. The file TODO lists all of the tags that are still not handled.

2.0.9   Feature Update
            1.) Added a function to the admin page to poll GitHub for the current release version, and notify
                the botmaster if a new version is available, providing a link to the latest version.

2.0.8   Performed the following upgrades/fixes:
            1.) Added version information to the admin page. so that botmasters can see at a glance which version
                they're using. This is a prelude to a new "version check" feature that I'm working on.
            2.) Corrected a bug where changing the bot's default page format wasn't being reflected in the config
                file. PLEASE NOTE that if you have several chatbots, this will affect ALL of them, but if that's
                the case, you shouldn't be relying on the default chatbot page anyway.

2.0.7   Two major changes, this time:
            1.) Removed some settings from the install script that had been causing new chatbots to
              fail to respond. These settings are still available in the admin pages, but during installation
              are given default values.
            2.) Added support for uploading ZIP file archives of AIML files, to make the process of adding
              AIML files less faster and less tedious. the size limit for uploading files is still 2MB,
              but a 2MB ZIP file can hold a LOT of AIML files. 

2.0.6   Performed the following upgrades/fixes:
            1.) Corrected typographical errors in several files, both in the admin pages, and in the config files.
            2.) Consolidated error logging, adding a /logs/ folder to the base directory. Error logs are
              also named for the pages where the errors occur. (e.g. admin.error.log for the admin pages,
              install.error.log, etc.)
            3.) Updated the addon checkForBan, activating it, and adding functionality to add banned users
              to the list of banned IP addresses. It's still up to the botmaster to implement banning in
              their AIML files. To ban a user, insert the following into the apropriate AIML template:
              <ban><get name="ip_address" /></ban>
          For further assistance, please check out the Program O Support Forums.

2.0.5   Bug fixes
            1.) Fixed a bug where uploaded AIML files were not being added to the DB, even if they passed validation.
            2.) Added the variable $default_charset to allow character encoding other than UTF-8 for both AIML files
                and chatbot pages.
            3.) Added experimental support for international characters. This is far from it's "final" implementation,
                but we hope that it's a start.

2.0.4   Fixed a bug in the debugging functions that caused empty debugging files to be created on non-Windows systems

2.0.3   Added simple AIML validation to the upload script, and restyled the admin pages accordingly

2.0.2   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.1   Unspecified Bug fixes

2.0.0   Initial Release
